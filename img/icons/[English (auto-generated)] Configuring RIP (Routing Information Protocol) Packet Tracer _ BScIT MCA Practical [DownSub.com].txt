hello guys is in the wind ready so today

we'll talk about our IP configuration

using Cisco packet tracer so for this

let me design our network we'll take one

machine here and second machine let's

place this here now to connect these two

machines again this these two machines

will also to two different network so

this machine belongs to a network called

as one ninety two dot one sixty eight

dot one dot zero and this machine

belongs to a network one ninety two dot

one sixty eight dot 2.0 so what I need

is I need to connect this to machine so

let me take a switch here so that I can

in future I can connect multiple

machines so let me take a switch here

and I will take one more switch at this

point now to connect this I need to go

out so let me take a generic router here

and this genrika out oh yeah it's

generator out here so what I have is I

have this network as 1.0 this network as

2.0 so let me just mention this

so this network is one ninety two dot

one sixty eight dot one dot zero and

this network one ninety two dot one

sixty eight dot 2.0

now to connect this we need a wire so on

this machine to this machine and from

from this machine to this machine okay

and to connect now from this machine to

this switch and here we go now I need to

connect these two routers also right so

we have to connect these two routers now

what I need is I need to configure this

network for this dog for this router for

this network and this router for this

network right now whenever you configure

this you have to configure your machines

first right again we are not going for

any dynamic IP we will be using some

static IP only so index table go to IP

configuration and here the Machine IP

will be 180 mm 168 of 1.2 this is your

mask and Gateway is one a two dot one

sixty eight dot one dot one now close

this machine give into the same

configuration for this machine desktop

IP configuration and 1 e 2 dot one sixty

eight dot 1000 us 1.1 it's not 2.2 and

gateway is 182 201 ninety two dot one

sixty eight dot one no its 2.1 okay now

now we have to configure this point and

this point so go to this router

configuration and in fast ethernet you

have to provide it default gateway light

so it's funny to do dot one sixty eight

dot one dot one and this is your mask

and on in this router you can do the

same thing configuration fast ethernet

your gateways money to do dot one sixty

eight dot 12.1 and you have to say on

now the routers are configured right

again we have to configure this link

also now this is one network this is

second network and between two routers I

have one more network and this network

let me define it as oh ten door

zero dot 0 dot 0 this is my network here

ok so this point will give as 10.10 dot

dot - this is 10.10 dollar 3 so go to

this router and with your serial port

because the again your when you

configure come to this wire you can see

this is your clock and we don't have a

clock here so this is your DC e and this

is your DTE so go to this router when

you set your serial 2/0 you have to

concentrate we have a clock there right

so let me set up clock as 64,000 so you

can take any number so let me give an IP

as one at n dot 10.0 r2 and this is your

mask and on now this port is on now you

have to on this port so come here and

not wash it on you see see this serial

port again in this side we don't have a

clock so we have just set theta as not

set and then dot 10 dot 0 dot

at that side we have to this side we

have to the and then you have to say on

now your routers are totally configured

right now what we need is when I when I

pick a packet from this router so from

this machine to router it's working

right it's because this router knows

about this machine all we can say this

machine knows about this router what if

if I take my packet from this machine to

this machine

it gives me failed it's because this

machine knows about this router or this

router knows about this router but this

router don't know anything about this

machine or this network so we have to

teach we have to teach this router how

to get to that machine and for this we

can either use static routing or we can

use our IP again for static I have have

already have a video on YouTube on my

channel so if you want to go for static

now this time we are going for our IP

okay so our IP is routing information

protocol in which you just have to

mention you just have to mention the

number of network this router knows so

this router knows about this network and

this network so just type here the

network

so it's one ninety two dot one sixty

eight dot one dot zero are going to do

this we have we have commands the

commands are the outer our IP again you

can do it using conjugation mode or GA

CLI mode so with configuration mode its

router our IP and in that we have to

mention the network address so add and

we need one movie we know one more

network is 10.0.0.0 and then we have to

say add ok now this is this router is we

have mentioned the our IP protocol here

again next thing is so you have to go to

configuration and in setting you just

have to save this in nvram okay so nvm

is non-volatile plan in which you can

save your configuration and you have to

say close now I have to do the same

thing for this router so you can use a

config or you can use a line so this

time will be will be UCLA you have to

come to the global configuration mode

this is your configuration mode and this

the command is router our IP and now you

have to mention the network address so

this router knows about 180 over one

sixty eight dot 2.0 and network we it

knows over to network so 10.0.0.0 and

that's it and to save go to

configuration settings and save okay and

this is also configure this is also we

have done the protocol for this router

also now to check if it is working or

not pick up packet from this machine to

this machine it comes fail you have to

wait for 10 seconds against which will

take some time router will take some

time again we are working with our IP

which updates it tables after every 25

seconds ok so till then we can check for

this router this should be connected

because obviously we are the IT content

them what our focus is my focus is to

drop a packet from this machine to this

machine and it's working right again you

can check the same thing using

simulation so using simulation what we

did do is pick a packet from this so

this machine to this machine and you can

run capture forward so capture forward

capture forward and capture forward

capture forward and all right so this is

how you have to work with your our IP

and I hope you learn something from it

now if you have any doubts please

comment also that I can solve your

doubts and do subscribe for further
